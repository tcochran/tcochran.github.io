I am going to explore the developer productivity topic with a series of posts. Improving developer productivity, has been a massive topic for me over the past year. I am continually asked about how teams and organizations can improve, and particularly how to measure it. This is both from business execs and from technical leaders.

Trying to answer this was part of the focus on my article on [maximizing developer effectiveness][maximizing-developer-effectiveness], which I drafted almost 4 years ago. The core concept was small micro improvements having a large compounding affect to software development. Moreover, it underscored the significance of focusing on the developer outcomes, fostering developer satisfaction and optimizing feedback loops. With the current industry focus I wanted to return to the developer productivity space, expand upon the article, sharing new learnings gained from helping companies be more productive.

Why is it such a hot topic right now? Various macro economic forces have meant we have come out of tech boom (or so it appears). Prior to 2020 if you are start or a scaleup finding invesment based on future potential revnue was easy, to build more software, or if my team was behind on a deadline, I could hire my way out of the problem. Enterprises were also seeing a slow down  – tightening on their revenue and project because consumers had less money to spend, which led to shrinking or cancelling of technical investments. We also saw this topic lead by the big tech, after the layouts, efficiency and productivity were common themes from leaders like Zuckerberg and Sahari. We are have been seeing innovations that are research like the DORA report, Space framework, and the tooling like ChatGPT and Internal developer portals promising massive improvements.

Of course making developers more productive is nothing new, it has been a theme in the history of computing, research groups, cloud vendors and startups are always looking for the next abstraction that improves productivity (garbage collectors, OO, cloud, kubernetes, lambda, low-code). However because of the all things I outlined there seems to be an extreme interest at the moment.

To start with exploration I will start by talking a little bit more about what I mean by developer productivity, and then I will follow up with what I have observed* as being the biggest impediments to productivity. I think if we put aside trying to measuring, it will allow us to to look at the topic more holistically, and consider different elements.

When I think about developer productivity, I use it to mean the value a developer produces for your company, I about that under a few aspects –

The first is development efficiency – the act of creating and putting reliable, high quality software in front of customers regularly. There are tons of tasks a developer does in their day to day journey that is laborious and slow, that can be improved  – writing boiler plate code, learning existing code, waiting for a build, recreating an issue, misunderstandings with colleagues etc.. This will make software development faster, and thus the developer produces more.

The other element I think about is how a developer can contribute to the overall success and effectiveness of the product they are building.

In my understanding of effective modern software development, what we ask a developer to do isn’t just writing code, it’s product ideas, it’s technical innovation, it’s risk reduction, it’s moral boasts, it’s cost saving, it’s mentoring & training.

Creating a successful product is complicated and consists of many different elements (and luck), it could be responding to customer feedback, increasing revenue, improving the cost efficiency, experimenting faster & cheaper, a great customer experience, useful features, cross-functional team performance, being able to correlate changes to changes in product metrics, all of these things a developer is critical to help “produce”, and most of the tasks aren’t writing code.

If we look at time to market, which is often a reason why for a company to look at developer productivity. A developer can code & ship faster that will help. They can also write less code. Great development in my opinion is finding a simplier solution to solve a problem, utilizing a library / third party service instead of custom code, and designing an experiment that allows us to validate the idea quicker.

Another element, is the strength of the product ideas. When I look at how a lot of software development is setup in a lot of organizations the developer’s are excluded from the idea generation part, this is the domain of the product manager and designers. There is ton’s of evidence and literature (not least that most recent technology ideas came from developers), on the strength of ideas from developers. There is a danger from some of the developer productivity initatives and tooling, is they simply ignore this. It’s almost back to the days of “the business” handing over a specificaiton to a developer to complete. A developer spends a lot of time impersed in the domain of the business, ruminating about customer problems, if we don’t leverage that deep thought and creativiely, we are loosing a lot of opportunity to produce more value.

In a lot of conversations I have about developer productivity it means just the first aspect, development efficiency. I have absolutely no problem with improving the tooling, platforms and pipelines (a large amount of my team’s work is this), it is critically important. However if we only do that, and we use the throughput of software development to mean the sole worth of a developer, that is where I get uncomfortable.

Now we have developer productivity defined, in my next post I will use some examples to illustrate more about what I mean.
