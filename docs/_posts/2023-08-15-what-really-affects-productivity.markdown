In the previous post, we examined what developer productivity means. How we often look to only to aspects relateated to improving developement efficiency.  To explore this futurer, this is a list of typical issues that developers end up wasting time on. 

#### Overengineering
A developer is constructing a complex solution that is flexible and scalable when the demands are not needed. It could be building to handle performance requirements that will make little difference to the current customer experience, designing for future customer and traffic growth when the product is an MVP, or creating a complex class design to allow for every eventuality.

#### Misunderstanding the product feature goals & design
Building the wrong thing due to a misunderstanding of the desired outcomes of a feature. Either not enough information was shared, or it was not clear enough. Often due to a different interpretation of the meaning of words or visuals. The misunderstanding gets caught late and introduces more rework if the developer doesn't collaborate with product and design counterparts often. 

#### Not building to the required standards
A developer doesn't understand what quality (code, architecture, security, performance, testing) their architect, quality team, or colleagues are looking for. Code commits continually get rejected or deployments are sent back late in the cycle. Coding conventions and design standards are often not agreed upon and documented, and different people can have widely different viewpoints.

#### Delayed Feedback
Product features are not split up in a way that allows for incremental product evolution. The feature requires multiple stories, and months go by before we can put it in front of a customer. There is a high chance that much code will have to be rebuilt. A worse situation is that the team ignores metrics and feedback because of the sunk cost, so the low-value features stay in the code base.

#### Missing Required skills
The developer does not have enough experience or hasnâ€™t completed adequate training in the technologies and tools they are using, and spends a lot of time learning while under pressure to deliver. If the team does not practice any rotation or pairing, the problem could be discovered late.
